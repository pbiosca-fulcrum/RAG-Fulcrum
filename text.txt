I need the following modifications:

1) Nice rendering on the /wiki/view . At the moment it is all stacked in "one line" and without breaklines. I want to preserve the format I would see on a markdown file, so # should be titles and things like these. Also bring the button to the bottom right and a bit more down.

3) The original documents are still not visible when clicked. The links do not work http://127.0.0.1:5782/uploads/2025/02/_Interest_Rate_Swap_Valuation__Yield_Curve_Construction_and_Analysis_.pdf
